#Development Roadmap

##Next Steps
The last element I will need in order to develop the cost estimation app for Cloak-Work is a text input field. I've got the basics of the buttons, text_views, and logic for button actions and passing values between fragments. The last bit I need is input fields for users to input their data.

I plan on implementing some kind of object-oriented data structure to hold all the values from the user. Then I can operate on them and spit the output out to another data structure.

Then I can walk through the output data structure in order to display the output on the final screen.
